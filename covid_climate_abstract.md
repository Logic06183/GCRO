# Environmental Factors and COVID-19 in Soweto: Insights from Separate Climate and Health Analyses

## Objective
This study aimed to characterize environmental factors (temperature and air quality) in Soweto during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze health outcomes from COVID-19 cases, exploring potential relationships despite limited temporal overlap in available data.

## Methods
We analyzed temperature data for Soweto (March 2020 to July 2020) and COVID-19 health outcomes (July 2020 to March 2022). Due to limited temporal overlap between datasets, we conducted separate analyses of environmental patterns and health outcomes, focusing on descriptive statistics and temporal trends.

## Results
During the early pandemic period (March to July 2020), Soweto experienced average temperatures of 13.8°C (range: -4.6°C to 27.7°C), with a clear seasonal cooling trend from autumn into winter. Health data analysis revealed seasonal patterns in respiratory symptoms and fever cases, with peak incidence in January 2021 (44 respiratory cases) and December 2020 (36 respiratory cases). The limited overlap between datasets (5 days) prevented direct correlation analysis between environmental factors and health outcomes.

## Conclusion
This study provides valuable characterization of environmental conditions and COVID-19 health outcomes in Soweto during different phases of the pandemic. While direct correlations could not be established due to data limitations, the separate analyses suggest seasonal patterns in both temperature and COVID-19 symptoms. Future research should prioritize concurrent collection of environmental and health data to enable more robust analysis of these relationships. These findings highlight the importance of integrated environmental health monitoring systems during public health emergencies.
