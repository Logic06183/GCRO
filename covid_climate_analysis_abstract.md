# Environmental Factors and COVID-19 in Soweto: Insights from Real Climate and Health Data

## Objective
This study aimed to characterize environmental factors (temperature and air quality) in Soweto during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze health outcomes from COVID-19 cases, exploring potential relationships between climate variables and health outcomes.

## Methods
We analyzed temperature data for Soweto (January 2015 to March 2022) and COVID-19 health outcomes (July 2020 to March 2022). With limited temporal overlap between datasets (284 days), we conducted both separate analyses of environmental patterns and health outcomes, as well as a preliminary correlation analysis for the overlapping period.

## Results
During the study period (January 2015 to March 2022), Soweto experienced average temperatures of 17°C (range: -4.6°C to 36.8°C). Health data analysis revealed seasonal patterns in respiratory symptoms and fever cases, with peak incidence in 2021-01 (44 respiratory cases). Respiratory symptoms were most prevalent during Autumn (rate: 0.117). The limited overlap between datasets (284 days) allowed for a preliminary correlation analysis, which suggested potential relationships that require further investigation with more data.

## Conclusion
This study provides valuable characterization of environmental conditions and COVID-19 health outcomes in Soweto during different phases of the pandemic. While comprehensive correlations could not be established due to data limitations, the analyses suggest seasonal patterns in both temperature and COVID-19 symptoms. Future research should prioritize concurrent collection of environmental and health data to enable more robust analysis of these relationships. These findings highlight the importance of integrated environmental health monitoring systems during public health emergencies.
