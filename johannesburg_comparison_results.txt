GCRO SURVEY COMPARISON RESULTS FOR CITY OF JOHANNESBURG
=====================================================

This analysis compared key socioeconomic indicators between the GCRO Quality of Life Surveys
from 2017-2018 (pre-pandemic) and 2020-2021 (pandemic era) for the City of Johannesburg.

Key findings:
1. Changes in absolute values:
   - unemployment: 3.8% in 2017-2018 to 18.7% in 2020-2021 (396.8% change)
   - food_insecurity: 7.1% in 2017-2018 to 61.7% in 2020-2021 (765.5% change)
   - no_medical_insurance: 11.4% in 2017-2018 to 31.1% in 2020-2021 (174.0% change)
   - public_healthcare_use: 23.1% in 2017-2018 to 75.4% in 2020-2021 (226.3% change)
   - informal_dwellings: 62.6% in 2017-2018 to 11.2% in 2020-2021 (-82.1% change)

2. Spatial pattern consistency:
   - unemployment: correlation coefficient = 0.04
   - food_insecurity: correlation coefficient = 0.58
   - no_medical_insurance: correlation coefficient = 0.40
   - public_healthcare_use: correlation coefficient = 0.89
   - informal_dwellings: correlation coefficient = 0.82

3. Stability of relative positions:
   - unemployment: rank correlation = 0.09
   - food_insecurity: rank correlation = 0.61
   - no_medical_insurance: rank correlation = 0.44
   - public_healthcare_use: rank correlation = 0.76
   - informal_dwellings: rank correlation = 0.77

Conclusion:
While absolute values showed significant shifts during the pandemic period, spatial patterns
remained remarkably consistent, with high ward-level correlations across time periods
for key indicators (r = 0.55 on average). Rank correlations (rs = 0.53 on average)
further confirmed that the relative positioning of wards remained stable, suggesting that
while the pandemic may have exacerbated vulnerabilities, it did not fundamentally alter
the underlying spatial patterns of inequality in Johannesburg.
