# Heat Exposure and Health Outcomes in Soweto: Environmental Justice Implications During the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Abstract for ISES-ISEE 2025 (Heat Center Project)

### Objective

This study investigates the relationship between heat exposure, air quality, and health outcomes in Soweto, South Africa, with a focus on environmental justice implications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Methods

We integrated data from the Gauteng City-Region Observatory Quality of Life Surveys (2017-2018 and 2020-2021), COVID-19 health data collected in Soweto during the pandemic, and climate data including temperature, heat index, and air pollutants. Statistical analyses included correlation analyses between heat metrics and health outcomes, assessment of heat vulnerability by socioeconomic status, and temporal trend analysis.

### Results

Our analysis revealed significant correlations between heat metrics and health outcomes, with heat index showing the strongest association with fever incidence (r=0.78) and respiratory symptoms (r=0.45). Socioeconomic disparities in heat vulnerability were pronounced, with low-income groups having limited access to cooling resources (5-10% access to air conditioning compared to 90% in high-income groups), resulting in a heat vulnerability index 5.7 times higher. Environmental justice analysis demonstrated that low-socioeconomic status (SES) communities experienced significantly higher exposure to air pollution (69% vs. 47% in high-SES areas), water quality issues (71% vs. 34%), and limited access to green spaces (55% vs. 35%). Temporal analysis demonstrated clear seasonal patterns, with heat-related cases increasing by 50% during summer months, while respiratory cases peaked during winter months in conjunction with elevated PM2.5 and NO2 levels.

### Conclusion

This study demonstrates significant relationships between heat exposure, air quality, and health outcomes in Soweto, with clear environmental justice implications. The findings highlight the disproportionate impact of extreme heat on socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, which was further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results emphasize the importance of integrating heat adaptation strategies and environmental health considerations into pandemic preparedness and response strategies, particularly in resource-limited urban settings.
